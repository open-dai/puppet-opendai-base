base

This is the base module of the classes of the Open-DAI project.
This module allows for the dynamic creation of the hosts in the Open-DAI architecture.
The role parameter is passes to the cloudstack environment at the creation of the new Vm or the hostname is used in the case of a different cloud environment that is not able to send the role attribute.

In this way a generic template is "morphed" dynamically to the required middleware component of the Open-DAI architecture, with all the configurations needed.
